# Quotenator

A simple quote generator using the api provided by [quotesondesign.com](https://quotesondesign.com/)

Technologies used are Jquery, CSS, HTML and Javascript.
The project is responsive in both pc view and mobile view and any UI improvement are most certainly welcomed.

All the background picture are downloaded from [pexel](https://www.pexels.com/)

Although the project are finished but there's much more improvement that could be done and add.

### Below are some to-do that I'm currently working on:

 - [ ] More background picture

 - [ ] Improve CSS usage
